
go is a tool for managing Go source code.
1. go run: it compiles and runs the application. It doesn't produce an executable
- go run file.go compiles and immediately runs Go programs.


2. go build: it just compiles the application. It produces an executable
- go build file.go compile a bunch of Go source files. It compiles packages and dependencies.
- If you run go build it will compile the files in the current directory and will produce an executable file with
the name of the current working directory.
- go build -o app will produce an executable file called app


Compiling for Windows GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o winapp.exe
Compiling for linux GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o winapp.exe
Compiling for Mac GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o macapp.exe

3. go install 
- Both go install and go build will compile the package in the current directory
- If the package is main, go build will place the resulting executable in the current directory and go install will
move the executable to GOPATH/bin
- When running go install you use paths relative to GOPATH/src
